# Installation Guide

This guide provides detailed steps to install and set up the eMoGis system, including software installations, project setup, and running the application.

## Software Installations

- Follow this [guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) to install Anaconda.
- Follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node. Prebuilt binaries/installer is the easiest way to perform installation.
- Follow this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download and install Visual Studio Code (vscode). You may use other code editors other than vscode as well.

This short [video]() illustrates how to perform these software installations.

## Project Setup

Download a zipped version of emogis from [here](https://github.com/komar41/eMoGis). Check the image below for reference on how to download the zip file from the link.

Unzip the folder. Now, open a terminal inside the **eMoGis** folder.

- Run the following commands in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies for the **eMoGis** Python library (Ignore the lines with hash (**#**). Those are comments explaining each command):

  ```bash
  # Navigate to the notebooks directory
  cd notebooks

  # Create a new conda environment
  conda create --prefix ./envs
  conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'

  # Activate the conda environment
  conda activate ./envs

  # Install necessary Python libraries
  conda install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib ipykernel fuzzywuzzy plotly

  # Install additional Python packages via pip
  pip install c3d
  pip install --upgrade nbformat
  ```

- Now, run the following commands in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies for the **server** side setup.

  ```bash
  # Navigate to the backend directory
  cd ../backend

  # Create a new conda environment
  conda create --prefix ./envs
  conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'

  # Activate the conda environment
  conda activate ./envs

  # Install necessary Python libraries
  conda install flask flask_cors pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn
  ```

- Finally, run the following command in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies for the client side setup.

  ```bash
  # Navigate to the frontend directory
  cd ../frontend

  # Install the necessary client side dependencies.
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```

This short [video]() illustrates how to setup the project.

## Run the application

- Open a terminal inside the eMoGis folder. Run the following commands in the terminal:

  ```bash
  # Navigate to the backend directory
  cd backend

  # Start the server
  python server.py
  ```

- Open another terminal inside the eMoGis folder. Run the following commands in the terminal:

  ```bash
  # Navigate to the frontend directory
  cd frontend

  # Start the web application
  npm start
  ```

  This will open a tab in your browser and you're all set to use **eMoGis** visual analytics (VA) system. We added some mock data inside the **"eMoGis/backend/data"** folder to illustrate the usage of the system. You should follow the same hierarchy and naming conventions for data storage displayed in the image below:

This short [video]() illustrates how to run the application and generate visualizations.

## Use the Python API

Follow this [link](https://github.com/komar41/eMoGis/blob/main/notebooks/README.md) to learn how to use the **eMoGis** python API. You can also watch this short [video tutorial]() to learn the usage of the Python API.
